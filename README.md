# 🌌 Multiverse Wheel

The **Multiverse Wheel** is a metaphysical framework for exploring the layered and cyclical nature of consciousness, faith, identity, and reality. It represents the evolving journey through various realms of belief, experience, and transformation—what some might call the spiritual multiverse.

Whether used for personal reflection, storytelling, or philosophical exploration, the Multiverse Wheel provides a dynamic lens on human and cosmic development.

## 🔄 The Eight Phases of the Wheel

1. **Awakening** – A sudden or gradual realization that reality is greater than it seems. The call beyond the material.
2. **Belief** – Embracing a worldview, ideology, or spiritual path that explains the cosmos and one’s place in it.
3. **Practice** – Rituals, actions, and habits that align the self with higher patterns or universal truths.
4. **Struggle** – Conflict between perceived truth and experienced reality. A descent into questioning and tension.
5. **Deconstruction** – Dismantling inherited or outdated belief systems. Entering the void between worlds.
6. **Reconstruction** – Reimagining meaning through integration of new knowledge and mystical insight.
7. **Integration** – Embodying multidimensional awareness. Living with coherence, depth, and cosmic empathy.
8. **Transcendence** – Moving beyond individual ego into the collective, eternal, or divine multiverse. A state of unity.

These stages spiral through time, identity, and consciousness. One may experience them in any order or return to previous phases with deeper understanding.

## 🧭 How to Use the Multiverse Wheel

- **Inner Exploration**: Identify your current phase and reflect on its implications across multiple domains (emotional, spiritual, intellectual).
- **World-Building**: Use the stages as a model for character arcs, philosophical systems, or universe design in storytelling.
- **Mentorship/Coaching**: Guide others through complex transitions using the wheel as a non-linear map of transformation.
- **Creative Practice**: Use the Wheel as a prompt for art, music, writing, or ritual.

## ✨ Core Beliefs

- Reality is multi-layered and consciousness travels across dimensions of meaning.
- Every phase has a lesson, challenge, and transformation.
- Doubt, paradox, and mystery are not obstacles—they are gateways.
- The Wheel is a guide, not a rule.
